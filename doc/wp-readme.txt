WordPress supports the use of custom shortcodes which allow plugins to insert custom content into pages. This plugin takes advantage of this functionality and creates an iframe that displays the booking form of Easy!Appointments. Include the `[easyappointments]` shortcode in the correct place of your published contents as shown in the following example.

`[easyappointments width="100%" height="500px" style="border: 5px solid #1A865F; box-shadow: #454545 1px 1px 5px;"]`

The "width", "height" and "style" attributes are optional but can help you to fine tune the styling of the iframe.
